Developing sound logical reasoning and critical thinking skills are critical for children's early development. Unfortunately, true logical challenges have been eclipsed by mindless games such as Flappy Bird. The main problem we face is the discrepancy between what is education and what is fun. We aim to bridge this divide, and create an educational which children will want to use and learn from, rather than being forced to. For inspiration, we looked to the past. The sudoku is a true and tested game of wits and logical reasoning. However, the lack of interaction and its slow pace make it unappealing to the short attention-span of a  child. Our app solves these problems by turning a slow traditional game of sudoku into a fast-paced multiplayer race to solve the board, where players get points for each square they complete, and penalized for incorrect answers.
